<p><strong><a href="https://gadgetstrack.com/crazybulk/">CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder</a> is a natural testosterone supplement made by Sculpt Nation. They claim it&rsquo;s a premium product designed to boost the production of the testosterone hormone in men and help them dominate their workouts by improving their athletic performance, energy levels, stamina, drive, and vitality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Produced in cGMP-compliant facilities and offering a money-back guarantee with every purchase, CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder makes purchasing seem risk-free. However, after conducting our own CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder review, it&rsquo;s clear that it is nothing more than a budget test booster with a premium price tag.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder&rsquo;s ingredients are all-natural and consist of zinc, Tribulus terrestris extract, Eurycoma longifolia root extract, epimedium grandiflorum powder, ashwagandha root extract, DIM, eleuthero powder, hawthorn berry extract, American Panax ginseng powder, and cordyceps mycelium powder.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While a few of its ingredients are useful in a testosterone booster, our CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder review found that most are present in doses too low to be effective. These ingredients are combined with others, with little scientific evidence proving they work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When we then looked at customer reviews of CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder, we had a similarly disappointing experience, as there were complaints about everything from its effects to the company&rsquo;s integrity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder cost is not unusual in testosterone supplements, but its level of efficacy is not enough to justify it. That&rsquo;s why we strongly suggest you do not buy CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder and instead try other testosterone boosters that have the optimal levels of their ingredients. Considering most people looking at CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder are looking for a muscle-building T booster, we recommend CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder as the best testosterone supplement option.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder Ingredients</strong><br /><strong>Zinc is a mineral and brittle metal element that stimulates the pituitary gland. It can increase luteinizing hormone production, testosterone production, testosterone levels, DNA synthesis, and metabolism, boost your sight, immune system, and recovery time, and reduce inflammation and the signs of aging (1).</strong></p>
<p><strong>With 10 to 45 mg being the recommended daily zinc intake, the 20 mg in each serving of CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder falls within the optimal range, so the formula looks pretty good.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tribulus Terrestris Whole Herb Extract &ndash; 500 MG</strong><br /><strong>Tribulus terrestris extract comes from a pantropic weed that has long been used in various traditional medicines worldwide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is said to offer a variety of health benefits, such as boosting your libido and sexual performance, health and functions, especially in men, combating issues like erectile dysfunction, and improving your natural testosterone production, free testosterone levels, and heart and kidney health and functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, except for its ability to combat erectile dysfunction, none of the claimed benefits of Tribulus terrestris extract have ever been conclusively proven (2). This means its presence in CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder is unlikely to provide any real benefit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eurycoma Longifolia Root Extract &ndash; 200 MG</strong><br /><strong>Eurycoma longifolia is a standardized water-soluble extract made from the roots of flowering plants in the Simaroubaceae family native to Indochina, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Long used in various traditional Asian medicines, it is believed by many to offer an incredible range of health benefits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This includes boosting testosterone levels, libido, energy levels, erectile function, and male sexual health, preventing or treating stress, headaches, high blood pressure, and pain, and improving your recovery from wounds, diseases, and various health conditions (3).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The problem is that none of these claims have been proven in clinical trials. This means eurycoma longifolia extract is another ingredient in CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder unlikely to produce the desired effects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epimedium Grandiflorum Leaves Powder &ndash; 160 MG</strong><br /><strong>Epimedium grandiflorum, better known as horny goat weed, has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine due to its flavonoid called icariin, which is said to be beneficial to human health.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is claimed to boost testosterone levels, energy, relaxation, blood flow, brain, heart, and immune health and functions, and your sex drive, and help treat or prevent erectile dysfunction, low libido, joint pain, inflammation, viral infections, heart disease, and high cholesterol and estrogen levels (4).</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, the ability to support the joints is the only claimed benefit that has ever been proven, and it is also linked to a long list of side effects. This means its presence in CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder is far more likely to harm you than raise your testosterone level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prolanza Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera) Root Extract &ndash; 150 MG</strong><br /><strong>Ashwagandha is a root extract from the winter cherry shrub that has long been used in ayurvedic medicine due to the impressive number of ways in which it can benefit human health. This includes being able to boost testosterone production and raise testosterone levels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It can also enhance muscle growth, strength, and overall physical performance, burn body fat, reduce stress, anxiety, and blood sugar levels, prevent the release of the stress hormone cortisol, and improve your focus, memory, sleep, and brain and heart health and functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Studies show that to produce these effects, you need to take ashwagandha extract in 300 mg doses (5). This means the 150 mg present in each serving of CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder is just half of what is required for full benefits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DIM (3,3&prime;-Diindolylmethane) &ndash; 100 MG</strong><br /><strong>DIM (diindolylmethane) is a phytonutrient made of indole and methane naturally found in cruciferous green vegetables. Known for its antioxidant and antineoplastic properties, it is also an anti-aromatase modulator that interacts with estrogen binding sites, stopping testosterone from turning into estrogen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It keeps your estrogen and testosterone levels balanced, improves brain, gut, and heart health and functions, hormone release, muscle growth, physical and sexual performance, and your overall health, boosts the immune system, and helps your body combat cold and flu symptoms more effectively (6).</strong></p>
<p><strong>DIM will produce these effects if consumed between 100 and 200 mg daily. As <strong><a href="https://gadgetstrack.com/crazybulk/">CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder</a></strong> contains 100 mg per serving, it will have some effect but will only produce the potential benefits of the compound at a minimal level.</strong></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://gadgetstrack.com/crazybulk/"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;Limited Discount: Get CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder at 70% off at the respectable website!&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></a></span></h2>
<p><strong>Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus Senticosus) Powder &ndash; 100 MG</strong><br /><strong>Eleuthero root extract is an adaptogen that comes from the Siberian ginseng plant. It is said to improve your physical performance, memory, brain, and immune health and functions and prevent or combat fatigue, low testosterone levels, diabetes, colds, and certain sexually transmitted diseases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, not only have most of these effects not been proven, but even those that have required taking at least 300 mg of eleuthero root per day to be produced (7). This means the 100 mg present in each dose of CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder is guaranteed to be somewhat useless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hawthorn Berry Extract (Crataegus Laevigata) &ndash; 40 MG</strong><br /><strong>Hawthorn berry extract is said to reduce inflammation, allergies, blood pressure, cholesterol, and oxidative stress, promote optimal testosterone production and blood flow, help you build lean muscle mass, keep the heart and digestive system healthy, and reduce anxiety and the effects of aging (8).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The problem is that most of the research into its effects is still in the early stages, and there is little proof that it provides benefits. This means there&rsquo;s a good chance its presence in CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder will not support male health.</strong></p>
<p><strong>American Panax Ginseng Root Powder &ndash; 20 MG</strong><br /><strong>Ginseng extract has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to produce many beneficial effects. This includes helping you maintain healthy testosterone levels, boosting your mood, immunity, and brain functions, and treating erectile dysfunction, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, ginseng extract must take at least 200 mg daily to produce these effects (9). This means the 20 mg in each serving of CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder is just 10 percent of what is required to be of use, so it will most likely be ineffective.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cordyceps Sinensis Mycelium Powder Extract &ndash; 20 MG</strong><br /><strong>Cordyceps mycelium is a parasitic fungus native to Asia that has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It can improve athletic performance, endurance, and heart, brain, and testicle health and functions, and prevent or treat low testosterone levels, the signs of aging, inflammation, high blood sugar levels, liver and kidney diseases, diabetes, tumors, diarrhea, headaches, coughs, and rheumatoid arthritis (10).</strong></p>
<p><strong>You need to consume at least 1,000 mg of cordyceps extract daily for it to do anything. Its inclusion is pointless, with CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder containing just 20 mg per serving.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder Reviews By Customers</strong><br /><strong>The average CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder review score looks quite promising on the surface, as the CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder testosterone booster holds a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars with previous users on Amazon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, when you look at the positive CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder reviews, most say they like it because it makes them feel a little happier and more energetic. The problem is that none of the reviews mentioned it benefited their testosterone levels or muscle mass.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Things worsen when you look at the negative CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder review section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not only do people say CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder produced no testosterone-boosting effects, and Sculpt Nation did not honor the advertised money-back guarantee, but some also mention they didn&rsquo;t find CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder safe, as it caused various side effects.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You combine all these user experiences with our own CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder review, and it appears CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder is not just an ineffective testosterone booster, it may be dangerous. That&rsquo;s why we would not recommend CrazyBulk D-BAL Muscle Builder under any circumstances.</strong></p>
